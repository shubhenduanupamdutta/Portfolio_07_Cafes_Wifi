# Portfolio_07_Cafes_Wifi

## Seventh (07) Portfolio Project 

## A website showing cafes in London with free wifi and amenities
- ### Website allows a user to add new cafes to the list
- ### It also allows a user to delete closed cafes from the list
> - #### I am not satisfied with it, I need some form of security before they delete a cafe entry. I will add that functionality when I have time.
